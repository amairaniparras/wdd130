    <p> Hello! My name is Amairani Parras and I am originally from Mexico, but I grew up here in Boston Ma. In my free time I like latin dancing, reading, hanging out with family and friends. I work as an accounting admin and becasue we've had to work closely with a softwear team it sparked my interest in persuing that kind of career. I'm new to this but im really excited to take this class and learn with everyone.</p>
