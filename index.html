    <p> Hello! My name is Amairani Parras and I am originally from Mexico, but I grew up here in Boston Ma. In my free time I like latin dancing, reading, hanging out with family and friends. I work as an accounting admin and becasue we've had to work closely with a softwear team it sparked my interest in persuing that kind of career. I'm new to this but im really excited to take this class and learn with everyone. My favoirte color is green, I love solving puzzles, in problems, math, code, or just actual puzzles. I find it helps me relax. Lately I have gotten into jiggy puzzles, I originally found them on shark tank a show which I love. I also like to watch new girl, sometimes I leave it on as back ground noise. I really like suspense shows and movies but I have to be careful or I will binge a whole season. I'm really excited for the live action of the little mermaid to come out even though the ocean gives me a bit of anxiety. </p>
